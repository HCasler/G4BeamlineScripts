Shielding_OptimizationV02:
Dave Hedin adjusted the study block volume dimensions to remove overlaps.

Shielding_OptimizationV10:
Major update
1) Changed NE blocks to regular concrete.
2) Switched all Barite blocks to 0.7 boron concrete.
3) Removed 2 NW blocks. Moved smaller block to PS cave
4) Defined new boron concrete material as the mixture of CONCRETE_MARS and BORON_CARBIDE
5) Changed cieling blocks to boron concrete
6) George adjusted design of the shielding in the penetration: blocks 4 and 5 

Shielding_OptimizationV11:
1) Updated the source location in Mu2e.in
2) Removed basic detectors from the stage 2

Shielding_OptimizationV12:
1) Moved source files to /grid/data/ area. 
Fraction of sections fail when accessing source files from /mu2e/data/
Ideally, we need to pre-stage source files.

Shielding_OptimizationV13:
Minor changes: NE block to boron, 2 NW blocks to regular concrete. Swicthed to 2M source files
