# A simple model of Calorimeter 
# 
# The calorimeter is made of two disks with the following dimensions
# - inner radius = 360 mm
# - outer radius = 670 mm
# - depth ~= 110 mm ( readout / casing not included)
#
# The front face of the disks are separated by 750 mm (i.e. the distance between the disks is 750-depth of the first disk)
# The front face of the first disk is located at z= 11750 in the mu2e coordinated, the x-y xoordinates are aligned on the tracker.
